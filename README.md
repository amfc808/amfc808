### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander Tae Yang Chang
- Iâ€™m interested in music production, firearms, aftermarket import vehicle modifications, and making the most income possible. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Engineering and possibly pursuing a BAM degree.
- I'm originally from Honolulu, Hawaii. I grew up in Hawaii Kai as a second generation Korean. 
- I'm a Computer Engineer.
- I chose my major because I was told that computer engineering allows me to pursue software, hardware, electrical and computer engineering jobs. Also, I want to be able to have no limitations with future family, necessaties and needs so I wanted to make the most income possible. I have no pure passion but rather enjoy being good at my job. I feel that is the best reward for my personality because I will not allow myself to pursue a career that I am passionate about but in poverty.
- A fun fact about me is:  I graduated with a sociology degree from manoa in 2019.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to be able to code on my own because I want to make the most income possible and I feel that the only potential pathway to get there is through software engineering. 
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Junji Ito Tales of the Macabre Series.
